## Changelog
```
-2.7

***From this release onwards, FOD has been reworked in order to be fully compatible and working with new A12 ROMs. It still might work on A11 ROMs and OOS 11, but to an extent. Because of that, there will be separate builds for A11 ROMs and OOS 11 without those changes, marked with "eleven" tag. So for example, for OOS 11, you would flash "Dora-Kernel-v2.7-eleven-sdcard_fs.zip".OOS 11 compatible build, so eleven-sdcardfs version is still staying as default for JSON configuration.***
